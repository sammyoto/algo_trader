What does a user need to make an algo?
- State
- Input data
- Input data frequency
- A preprogrammed algo. No customization here

TODO:
- Finish Trader
- Centralize trader scheduling, maybe traders don't subscribe to Redis anymore, they are part of a scheduler and get their data independently
- All traders want to do are input data, run an algorithm, update their state.
- Each algorithm has to have a trade trigger
- Make it fully customizable, what do we want to store from endpoints? What functions do we want to run? What's our trade trigger?
