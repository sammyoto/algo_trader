Redesigning the backend for scalability to as many bots as needed

- api layer on top for frontend control
- backend manager (we have data and bots, find a good way to manage this)
- use data models, anytime there is raw dictionary processing its bad
- figure out a way to store data from bots in a cheap way
- look into a message broker for clean frontend communication (Redis)
